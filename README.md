## About the Game
![Image](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE2NzMwNzQ0LnBuZw==/original/SCSTK6.png)

<br/>

Following a zombie outbreak, survivors have banded together to try to survive, just one slight problem‚Ä¶ They are incredibly dumb! 

These survivors don't have weapons or know how to navigate the environments, so one brave member decides to go out and clear the way.

Throughout the player‚Äôs travels, stranded survivors can be rescued and join the group, these survivors act as extra lives, if the player is eaten, falls to their demise or even has a heartache, a new survivor steps up to lead the herd.

Alongside keeping themselves alive, the player also has to protect the group from the undead, at first it will be returning and fighting zombies but overtime as the player gets more weapons and coins, the group will start gaining weapons and protect each other while you clear a path.
